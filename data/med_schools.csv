Case-Based Learning (CBL) is a tutorial-based, group learning approach where students work through real-world clinical scenarios across subjects such as cardiology, respiratory, and gastroenterology. During each session, you'll identify key learning outcomes and use them to guide your study, following a patient case from initial presentation through to diagnosis and management. The goal of CBL is to help students apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. This better prepares you for reviewing real cases during clinical placements. What is Problem-Based Learning? The main emphasis of problem based learning (PBL) is on small group working, centred around a  €˜problem' or scenario. These scenarios are hypothetical patient cases. This integrated approach, centred on PBL, and grounded in a robust scientific understanding, strong clinical knowledge and highly developed communication and clinical reasoning skills, allows you to develop life-long skills that will be crucial to your success as a doctor.",Clinical work experience is not mandatory.
